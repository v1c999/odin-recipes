        <h3>Servings</h3>
        <p>16 servings</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2/3 cup cocoa powder, sifted if lumpy</li>
            <li>1/2 cup powdered sugar, sifted if lumpy</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dark chocolate chips</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoons sea salt</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup canola oil or extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325Â°F. Lightly spray an 8x8 baking dish (not a 9x9 dish or your brownies will overcook) with cooking spray and line it with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, powdered sugar, chocolate chips, and salt.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, water, and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the dry mix over the wet mix and stir until just combined.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan (it'll be thick - that's ok) and use a spatula to smooth the top. Bake for 40 to 48 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with only a few crumbs attached (note: it's better to pull the brownies out early than to leave them in too long). Cool completely before slicing.*** Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. These also freeze well!</li>
        </ol>
